All Features of AHK:
- voice acting
- bootstrap programm on Windows startup
- hotstrings
- states: double / triple / multi click 
- mouse wheel?
- external numPad

I will be glad to hear the comparisons of AHK with Python, Bash and other analogues. Are they more flexible, easier, more concise? (my Telegram: https://t.me/nBozhok)
