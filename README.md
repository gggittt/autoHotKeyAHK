All Features of AHK:
- voice acting
- - by timer, date, delay 
- bootstrap programm on Windows startup
- hotstrings
- - ru/eng
- states: double / triple / multi click 
- mouse wheel?
- external numPad
- try to replace programs:
- - punto (shift, Insert)
- - keyManager All (write out all the functions of the which will not work)

I will be glad to hear the comparisons of AHK with Python, Bash and other analogues. Are they more flexible, easier, more concise? (my Telegram: https://t.me/nBozhok)
